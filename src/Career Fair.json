As part of the Marvin Family of Brands, Integrity was born form the company's century-long heritage of craftsmanship and quality with a focus on performance and durability.\rThe company manufactured their first windows in Marvin’s factory in Warroad Minn. in 1994, but soon realized that Integrity would need a dedicated facility to meet production demand. Integrity made the move to Fargo in 1995. Trucks were loaded with equipment over a weekend, and the production line was operational the following week.\rIntegrity’s presence in Fargo has expanded since 1995 as fiberglass continues to be one of the fastest growing window and door materials in the industry. Currently, there are three window and door plants located in the Fargo area, as well as a facility in Roanoke, VA.\rThe Integrity facility has more than doubled in size in recent years and now has 400,000 square feet of production and office space for its 350 employees. With the recent expansion of the facility, new production lines have been set up to provide for three years of growth.\rIntegrity's goal is to continue to bring to market high performance window and door packages that are the valued leaders in the industry. There are distribution sites throughout the nation and abroad, with consistent on-time delivery supported by professional service personnel, up-to-date technology and processes.",

From a simple maintenance project to design-build of a fast track facility, we execute each project with persistent accountability. \r\rThe firm was founded by Luther Hill in 1968 on the belief in strict standards for quality and safety. He gained national attention for building big business projects with a small business attitude. Greg Wilkinson and Fritz McKinstry carried on his legacy when they bought the company in 1985. Now, Paul Driscoll, CEO, is leading the firm into the future with a commitment to retaining the culture and principles that have been central to our success. Many things have changed as we have evolved into a $450 million firm, but our philosophy and core values have remained the same - respect, quality, safety, training, fun, citizenship and commitment to the communities we serve. Our “Process Driven Design and Construction” concept drives everything we do.\r\rAs leaders in the construction business we strive to bring trust, respect, honesty and good old-fashioned hard work to every project. We have built a solid reputation among our clients and peers.",
